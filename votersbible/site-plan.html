      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wished you had one place to go to compare all the candidates running for offices stances on different platforms? This is the site for you. This website will compile all the candidates running for office and their opinions on the different matters. You will no longer be a that name sounds good voter. You will be educated.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is residents of Utah (for now) who are citizens, 18 years of age and older. They would like to vote; I will have a link to voter registration. That way if they are not registered, they can do so. My audience wants to do what is best for this country and vote to the best of their knowledge. It is also for those who cannot yet vote but want to start familiarizing themselves with the candidates. They would like to know what they are talking about when they discuss politics. </p>  <!-- change this -->
