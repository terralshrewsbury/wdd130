    <h2>Terral Shrewsbury</h2>
    <h2>AKA: Mom, Turrtle, Shrewselberry, Alligator Lady</h2>

    <p>Hello, World! I am Terral Shrewsbury. I live in Clinton UT. I am a mother of two and have been happily married for 15 years. I put some funny nicknames I've acquired over the years. Turrtle, with two r’s representing the two r’s in my name, was a nickname that I grew up with. It started out as my parents teasing me for being so slow when they were ready to go. Then in junior high I said OK I'm going to accept this nickname and it became my name, even some of my teachers only know me by turrtle. Shrewselberry was a nickname that my young women gave me up at camp. I have been serving in the young women for four years now. Alligator lady is a nickname I have acquired through my stake. I was the young women camp music director last year and taught the girls an alligator song so now people come up to me and are like,” you're the alligator lady right?” </p>

    <p>I am heading for web design and development degree. The Lord put me on this path long ago and I'm finally able to go to school for it. I have a goal and a vision of a website that I am supposed to create to help the democratic process in the United States.</p>

    <p>Some of the things that I love to do I've picked up because I have this desire to learn. It is an unquenchable desire. When people ask me what my favorite hobby is I often tell them learning. I've gotten several weird looks. I have learned many skills and hobbies. I often reverence the old quote, “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” I of course sub out jake for jane.</p>

    <p>One last thing my mantra. All who know me hear me quote this regularly and I even have a washer that I imprinted with the words that I wear around my wrist. It is try, try again. It is a beautiful poem. I highly recomend reading it.</p>
